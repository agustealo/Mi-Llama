## Mi Llama: MindsDB and Ollama LLM Chat Application with Streamlit UI

### Overview

Mi Llama integrates MindsDB and Ollama with Streamlit to create an interactive chat application, similar to ChatGPT, but with enhanced customization and personalization capabilities. Users can ask questions, and the application responds using locally hosted language models. What sets Mi Llama apart is its ability for your AI models to improve their knowledge base on-the-fly using MindsDB, allowing for personalized responses and adaptation to specific use cases. The project includes a user-friendly sidebar interface for easy customization and configuration.

Mi Llamaâ€™s unique feature set makes it ideal for a variety of applications, such as dynamic customer support, personalized tutoring systems, and intelligent virtual assistants that learn and adapt over time. By leveraging the power of MindsDB, Mi Llama can seamlessly update its knowledge base with new information, making it particularly effective in environments where information frequently changes or requires constant updates.
